# Medusa Simulation
This repository holds the Medusa Simulation code stack for underwater marine vehicles of DSOR-ISR (Dynamical Systems for Ocean Robotics - Institute for System Robotics). It contains the necessary components to simulate and control the MEDUSA class of marine vehicles. It provides 2 types of simulation. A matlab like simulation written in C++ and another using gazebo simulator.
